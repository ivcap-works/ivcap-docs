# Architectural Decision Records

A section to **_collect and record any technical and/or architecture decisions_** made for the project.

For a background to ADRs see <https://adr.github.io/>

To use:

1. Make a copy of the [_template.md](./_template.md) file
3. Take the number of the last ADR logged, add 1 and include in the heading/title of the ADR
4. If an ADR supersedes, augments or is related to another ADR please reflect that in the Technical Story section
5. Include links to features, stories, issues, to which this decision is related (incl. spikes)
6. Use diagrams if relevant/easier
