# Tutorial: Agent Using Agent on IVCAP

> Please note, that this tutorial assumes that you already familiar with
the basics of developing and deploying IVCAP services. If not, you may first
check out the [Building a Gene Ontology (GO) Term Mapper Tool](https://github.com/ivcap-works/gene-onology-term-mapper) tutorial

In this tutorial we will create two simple agents, a report writer
and a fact checker assessing the references used in the report.

## Example Output

```bash
% cd report_writer && poetry ivcap job-exec tests/solar.json
Running: ivcap context get account-id

## Fact Checker

This agent takes a list of references as input and for every one of them, it asks an LLM to provide it with an assessment using the following prompt.

  * __system__: You are a critical academic reviewer.
  * __user__: Assess the credibility and relevance of this reference: {ref}

The implementation can be found in the [fact_checker](./fact_checker/) subdirectory.

The [fact_checker.py](./fact_checker/fact_checker.py) implements the agent's functionality as an IVCAP _lambda_ service. The remaining files, [pyproject.toml](./fact_checker/pyproject.toml), [Dockerfile](./fact_checker/Dockerfile) and [Makefile](./fact_checker/Makefile) support the standard IVCAP testing and deployment process with some test files in [fact_checker/tests](./fact_checker/tests/) for local testing.

## Report Writer

The report writer in the [report_writer](./report_writer/) subdirectory follows a very similar script with the implementation found in [report_writer.py](./report_writer/report_writer.py).

The initial report on a specific topic is sent to an LLM using the
following prompts:

  * __system__: You are a science writer.
  * __user__: Write a concise summary about "{topic}". <br>
  Include at least 2 well-formatted references at the end, like:<br>
    [1] Author/Source - URL <br>
    [2] Author/Source - URL

After receiving the reply from the LLM, the included references are processed by `check_references` (in [report_writer.py](./report_writer/report_writer.py#L107)):

```python
def check_references(report_text: str, request: ReportRequest, ctxt: JobContext):
    """Check the references using the fact checker service."""

    # Find the references which are lines starting with '['
    references = [line.strip() for line in report_text.splitlines() if line.strip().startswith("[")]

    ...

    # get the id of the fact checking agent to use
    fact_checker = request.fact_checker
    agent_id = fact_checker.agent_id
    if not agent_id:
        raise ValueError("Fact checker agent ID is required")
    # use the IVCAP client provided through the JobContext
    agent = ctxt.ivcap.get_agent(agent_id)
    # create a schema checked request for this agent
    req_model = agent.request_model
    req = req_model(
        references=references,
        model=fact_checker.model,
        temperature=fact_checker.temperature,
    )
    # Call the agent and wait for a reply
    job = agent.exec_agent(req)
    if not job.succeeded:
        raise RuntimeError(f"Fact checking job failed: {job.error}")

    # extract result and return
    result = job.result["results"]
    return result
```
