# Running Locally

## Service description

Users use the service description metadata to search and discover the services.
The Service information should describe what the service does, the context in which it works, any parameters it needs, and the artifacts it creates.

[Examples of artifacts and output include: ...]: #

## Local Environment Requirements

Local development requirements include suggested programming languages, and the supporting software to be build and sustain a local development environment.

Tip:  Containerised applications do not have access to your local build environment, nor its environment variables.  Use of the XXXX development environment mimics the server environment, minimising the risk of errors.

### Software and tools {#software}

[Assuming Researcher just getting started not be a seasoned dev.  early success is good success]: #

The software environment you will need includes:

- what is the list of software which will need to be installed for a local dev/run environment?
- what is the install configuration for each (where changes are required)
- what does the developer/researcher need to have on their computer to run a make file and build a (sample / stub) local service.  i.e. cloning a/the Git repo?
- How do they run a make
- How do they run the service and interact with it?
