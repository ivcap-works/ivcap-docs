# Quick Start

To see how IVCAP works, you can _order_ the simple `hello-world` service and view  the computed _artifacts_.

Before you start you need to have access to an IVCAP deployment and have the `ivcap-cli` tool installed and make sure you have logged in using the authentication provider of therespective IVCAP deployment.

> _The following needs to be updated with current ivcap-cli settings_

First, let's try to find the service:

```
ivcap services list
```

* ... then order it
* ... check on progress
* ... list created artifacts
* ... download image

## Installing `ivcap-cli`

Download the relevant binary from [github](https://github.com/reinventingscience/ivcap-cli/releases/latest) and configure the relevant IVCAP context. For more details see [local page for ivcap_cli]().
